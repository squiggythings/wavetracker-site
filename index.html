                    <p>
                        WaveTracker is a free and
                        <a href="https://github.com/squiggythings/WaveTracker">open source</a> music-making software for
                        Windows. It uses wavetable synthesis and sampling to generate sounds, with endless combinations
                        of effects to warp, modify or distort waves and sounds.
                    </p>

                                Wavetracker does not emulate any hardware chips. It uses its own internal audio engine
                                and samples to generate its sound.

                                The Vxx effect will tell a channel which wave from the bank to use. Alternatively, wave
                                instruments have a 'Wave Envelope' if you want to automate a sequence of waves over
                                time.

                                If you want an instrument to always use a specific wave or sequence of waves, you can
                                create a 'Wave' envelope to automate what waves the instrument will use while playing.

                    <p>
                        WaveTracker started out as a university project and quickly grew into a full tracking software.
                        It was developed by
                        <a href="https://eliasananiadis.com">Elias Ananiadis</a> (@squiggythings) with the
                        <a href="https://monogame.net/">Monogame</a> and
                        <a href="https://github.com/naudio/NAudio">NAudio</a> C# libraries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        ~ I based it off of some of my favorite chiptune/music editing tools, most notably Famitracker
                        and pxTone Collage. In a way, it combines the tracker and instrument editing interface of
                        Famitracker, with the audio and sample playback capabilities of pxTone, plus some extra bells
                        and whistles.
